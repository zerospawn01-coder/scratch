# Repository Split Runbook for PowerShell

## 🚀 Quick Execution (TL;DR)

**[OPERATOR PANEL :: FAST PATH]**

If you have already performed the pre-flight checks and the destination repositories exist, run these commands in order:

```powershell
# 1. Setup Environment
$env:ROOT = "$HOME\work"
$env:SCRATCH = Join-Path $env:ROOT "scratch"
$env:COG = Join-Path $env:ROOT "cognitive-lab"
$env:EAAOL = Join-Path $env:ROOT "ea-aol"
$env:MTP = Join-Path $env:ROOT "mtp-weaver"
$env:LABEXP = Join-Path $env:ROOT "lab-experiments"

# 2. Execute Copy-Based Repos (Phase 1)
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_copy.ps1 -Layout recommended

# 3. Execute History-Preserving Repos (Phase 2)
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_filter_repo.ps1 -Layout recommended -Push

# 4. Finalize Archive State
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_archive.ps1 -Layout recommended -ExcludedAction archive
```

## 🔎 Overview: The Sovereign Split Protocol

**[SYSTEM PANEL :: ARCHITECTURE_REFACT]**

This runbook defines the deterministic procedure for splitting the monolithic `scratch` repository into a multi-repo architecture on Windows systems. It utilizes PowerShell-native commands and `git-filter-repo` to ensure idempotency and history preservation.

### Target Layouts

- **Recommended (5-Repo)**: `cognitive-lab`, `ea-aol`, `mtp-weaver`, `lab-experiments`, `project-manuals`
- **Minimal (4-Repo)**: `cognitive-lab` (with docs), `ea-aol`, `mtp-weaver`, `lab-experiments`

## 📋 Migration Mapping & Causal Invariants

**[STRATEGY PANEL :: MAPPING_TRUTH]**

### Primary Successor

- `zerospawn01-coder/cognitive-lab`

### Independent Project Repositories

- `zerospawn01-coder/ea-aol`
- `zerospawn01-coder/mtp-weaver`

### Experiment Repository

- `zerospawn01-coder/lab-experiments`

### Support Repository

- `zerospawn01-coder/project-manuals`

### Optional Archive Repository

- `zerospawn01-coder/scratch-archive`

## 2. Migration Mapping

Use this as the canonical source-to-target mapping before executing any split commands.

| Source path in `scratch` | Target repository | Target path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.github/` | `cognitive-lab` | `.github/` | Keep active CI with the core repository |
| `post_alignment_lab/` | `cognitive-lab` | `post_alignment_lab/` | Active core component |
| `intuition-layer/` | `cognitive-lab` | `intuition-layer/` | Active core component |
| `analyze_leap.py` | `cognitive-lab` | `leap_analysis/analyze_leap.py` | Rehome under a dedicated LEAP directory |
| `run_leap_analysis.py` | `cognitive-lab` | `leap_analysis/run_leap_analysis.py` | Rehome under a dedicated LEAP directory |
| `leap_analysis_core.py` | `cognitive-lab` | `leap_analysis/leap_analysis_core.py` | Rehome under a dedicated LEAP directory |
| `test_leap_analysis.py` | `cognitive-lab` | `leap_analysis/test_leap_analysis.py` | Keep test with LEAP code |
| `LEAP_ANALYSIS_README.md` | `cognitive-lab` | `leap_analysis/README.md` | Normalize name after move |
| `CI_CD_SETUP.md` | `cognitive-lab` | `CI_CD_SETUP.md` | Keep CI guidance with the active core repo |
| `ea-aol/` | `ea-aol` | `/` | Preserve history with `git filter-repo` |
| `mtp_weaver/` | `mtp-weaver` | `/` | Preserve history with `git filter-repo` |
| `jepa_intuition_poc/` | `lab-experiments` | `jepa_intuition_poc/` | POC work grouped to avoid repo sprawl |
| `geodesic_descent/` | `lab-experiments` | `geodesic_descent/` | Experiment grouped into the shared lab repo |
| `personal_ai/` | `lab-experiments` | `personal_ai/` | Personal exploratory work grouped with experiments for now |
| `project_manuals/` | `project-manuals` | `/` | Separate docs/support repo in the 5-repo layout |
| `CODE_QUALITY_REVIEW.md` | `cognitive-lab` or `scratch-archive` | `docs/reports/` | Prefer `cognitive-lab/docs/reports/` if still relevant |
| `CRITICAL_EVALUATION_REPORT.md` | `cognitive-lab` or `scratch-archive` | `docs/reports/` | Prefer `cognitive-lab/docs/reports/` if still relevant |
| `FINAL_UNIT_TEST_REPORT.md` | `cognitive-lab` or `scratch-archive` | `docs/reports/` | Move only if it documents active systems |
| `FINAL_WORK_SUMMARY.md` | `scratch-archive` or `cognitive-lab` | `docs/archive/` | Usually archival rather than production docs |
| `TODAY_WORK_SUMMARY.md` | `scratch-archive` or `cognitive-lab` | `docs/archive/` | Usually archival rather than production docs |
| `UNIT_TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` | `cognitive-lab` or `scratch-archive` | `docs/reports/` | Keep only if it supports current CI work |
| `PUBLICATION_READINESS_REPORT.md` | `cognitive-lab` or `scratch-archive` | `docs/reports/` | Keep near active publication work |

## 3. Minimal 4-Repository Fallback

If the dedicated-repository layout is too heavy to operate right now, use this reduced target map.

| Source path in `scratch` | Target repository | Target path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `post_alignment_lab/` | `cognitive-lab` | `post_alignment_lab/` |
| `intuition-layer/` | `cognitive-lab` | `intuition-layer/` |
| LEAP-related root files | `cognitive-lab` | `leap_analysis/` |
| `ea-aol/` | `ea-aol` | `/` |
| `mtp_weaver/` | `mtp-weaver` | `/` |
| `jepa_intuition_poc/` | `lab-experiments` | `jepa_intuition_poc/` |
| `geodesic_descent/` | `lab-experiments` | `geodesic_descent/` |
| `personal_ai/` | `lab-experiments` | `personal_ai/` |
| `project_manuals/` | `cognitive-lab` | `docs/manuals/` |

Minimal-layout note: `project_manuals/` is the only confirmed compression relative to the 5-repo recommended layout. Additional non-core reviewed directories are deferred rather than squeezed into `lab-experiments` during phase 1.

## 4. Recommended Creation Order

1. `cognitive-lab`
2. `ea-aol`
3. `mtp-weaver`
4. `lab-experiments`
5. `project-manuals`

## 5. Current Workspace Note

The current workspace already resembles `project-manuals` more than a full `scratch` checkout.

- Operator documentation is concentrated here.
- UI, contracts, and phase runbooks are present.
- The directories named in the broader split plan such as `post_alignment_lab/`, `ea-aol/`, and `mtp_weaver/` are not present in this workspace snapshot.

Treat this runbook's mapping table as the planning source of truth, then validate against the full `scratch` tree before executing the split.

## 6. Verified `scratch` Inventory Snapshot

The parent `scratch` checkout was inspected at top level on 2026-03-14.

### Confirmed Present and Covered by Current Mapping

The following planned split inputs are confirmed to exist in the real `scratch` tree:

- `post_alignment_lab/`
- `intuition-layer/`
- `ea-aol/`
- `mtp_weaver/`
- `jepa_intuition_poc/`
- `geodesic_descent/`
- `personal_ai/`
- `project_manuals/`
- `analyze_leap.py`
- `run_leap_analysis.py`
- `leap_analysis_core.py`
- `test_leap_analysis.py`
- `LEAP_ANALYSIS_README.md`
- `CI_CD_SETUP.md`
- `CODE_QUALITY_REVIEW.md`
- `CRITICAL_EVALUATION_REPORT.md`
- `FINAL_UNIT_TEST_REPORT.md`
- `FINAL_WORK_SUMMARY.md`
- `TODAY_WORK_SUMMARY.md`
- `UNIT_TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`
- `PUBLICATION_READINESS_REPORT.md`

### Present but Deferred from the Optimized 5-Repo Phase

These top-level directories exist in `scratch` but are intentionally deferred from the optimized 5-repo migration so the first move stays centered on CI-backed core work and a small number of repositories:

- `aesthetic-resonator/`
- `AI-Browser-Core/`
- `antigravity_dashboard/`
- `Antigravity-Forge/`
- `autonomous-task-gen/`
- `clean-room-v1.0.0/`
- `cognitive-substrate/`
- `live_agents/`
- `mvp_halt/`
- `sovereign-arena-chaos/`
- `system_sentinel/`
- `tts_narrator/`

### Interpretation

- The current mapping is now partially confirmed rather than purely conceptual.
- The remaining migration risk is concentrated in the deferred and placeholder directories listed above.
- Do not treat the split as final until those directories are either revisited in a later split pass, archived, or intentionally excluded.

## 7. Deferred Directories Outside the Optimized 5-Repo Phase

The table below captures directories that were inspected but are not part of the optimized 5-repo move. They remain candidates for a later second-pass split or archive cleanup.

- `README` presence
- manifest presence such as `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, or `requirements.txt`
- `tests` presence
- whether the directory already looks like a self-contained product or only an experiment snapshot

An extra `archive/exclude` bucket is used here because some paths are effectively placeholders rather than live projects.

| Directory | README | Manifest / Tests | First-pass destination | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `aesthetic-resonator/` | No | No manifest, no tests | deferred | Leave in `scratch` for a later pass; it is not on the active CI-backed path |
| `AI-Browser-Core/` | No root README, nested `.git` present | Cohesive `api/`, `core/`, `tests/` tree | deferred | Viable later split candidate, but not needed for the optimized 5-repo first move |
| `antigravity_dashboard/` | No | No manifest, no tests | `archive/exclude` | Only `__pycache__/` is present at root, so there is no meaningful project payload to split right now |
| `Antigravity-Forge/` | Yes | `Cargo.toml` present | deferred | Viable later split candidate, deferred to avoid repo sprawl in phase 1 |
| `autonomous-task-gen/` | No | Nested TS package and Python pipeline, no root tests | deferred | Leave in `scratch` until there is a reason to split or archive it |
| `clean-room-v1.0.0/` | No | No root manifest, no tests | deferred | Packaged snapshot left for later cleanup |
| `cognitive-substrate/` | Yes | Standalone Python files and `test_integration.py` | deferred | Viable later split candidate, but not needed for the optimized first move |
| `live_agents/` | No | No root manifest, no tests | deferred | Mostly generated/logging payload, so leave for later cleanup |
| `mvp_halt/` | No | No root manifest, no tests | deferred | Leave in `scratch` for a second-pass review |
| `sovereign-arena-chaos/` | No | Large self-contained Python codebase, config, models, telemetry | deferred | Viable later split candidate, deferred to keep the first move small |
| `system_sentinel/` | No | No manifest, no tests | `archive/exclude` | Directory is currently empty |
| `tts_narrator/` | No | No manifest, no tests | `archive/exclude` | Only `__pycache__/` is present at root |

### Classification Summary

- Deferred for a later split or cleanup pass: `aesthetic-resonator/`, `AI-Browser-Core/`, `Antigravity-Forge/`, `autonomous-task-gen/`, `clean-room-v1.0.0/`, `cognitive-substrate/`, `live_agents/`, `mvp_halt/`, `sovereign-arena-chaos/`
- Likely archive or exclude: `antigravity_dashboard/`, `system_sentinel/`, `tts_narrator/`

### Immediate Implication

- The optimized 5-repo split keeps the first move centered on the active CI-backed core plus two clearly independent projects, one shared experiments repo, and one docs repo.
- The 4-repo fallback still works by folding `project_manuals/` into `cognitive-lab/docs/manuals/`.
- Additional reviewed directories remain in `scratch` for a later split or cleanup pass rather than forcing more repositories now.

### Current Optimized Repository Set

The optimized first-pass repository set is:

- `zerospawn01-coder/cognitive-lab`
- `zerospawn01-coder/ea-aol`
- `zerospawn01-coder/mtp-weaver`
- `zerospawn01-coder/lab-experiments`
- `zerospawn01-coder/project-manuals`

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

**[CONFIG PANEL :: POWERSHELL_VARS]**

```powershell
$env:ROOT = "$HOME\work"
$env:SCRATCH = Join-Path $env:ROOT "scratch"

$env:COG = Join-Path $env:ROOT "cognitive-lab"
$env:EAAOL = Join-Path $env:ROOT "ea-aol"
$env:MTP = Join-Path $env:ROOT "mtp-weaver"
$env:LABEXP = Join-Path $env:ROOT "lab-experiments"
```

## 🛡️ Preflight Checks: Integrity Verification

**[GATE PANEL :: PRE_SPLIT_AUDIT]**

```powershell
Set-Location $env:SCRATCH
git status
git branch --show-current
git remote -v
```

If there are uncommitted changes, checkpoint them first:

```powershell
git add -A
git commit -m "Checkpoint before repo split"
```

Optional safety tag:

```powershell
git tag pre-split-scratch
```

## 11. Clone Empty Destination Repositories

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/zerospawn01-coder/cognitive-lab.git $env:COG
git clone https://github.com/zerospawn01-coder/ea-aol.git $env:EAAOL
git clone https://github.com/zerospawn01-coder/mtp-weaver.git $env:MTP
git clone https://github.com/zerospawn01-coder/lab-experiments.git $env:LABEXP
```

HTTPS is the recommended transport for this workspace. Keep SSH as an optional fallback only after host keys and credentials are configured.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Creating `cognitive-lab`

**[EXECUTION PANEL :: CORE_MIGRATION]**

For a concise operator checklist focused only on this first move, use `COGNITIVE_LAB_PHASE1_CHECKLIST.md` alongside this section.

### 12.1 Create Directory Layout

```powershell
Set-Location $env:COG

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "leap_analysis" | Out-Null
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "docs\manuals" | Out-Null
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "docs\reports" | Out-Null
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path ".github\workflows" | Out-Null
```

### 12.2 Copy Active Components from `scratch`

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force (Join-Path $env:SCRATCH "post_alignment_lab") .
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force (Join-Path $env:SCRATCH "intuition-layer") .

Copy-Item -Force (Join-Path $env:SCRATCH "analyze_leap.py") "leap_analysis\"

Copy-Item -Force (Join-Path $env:SCRATCH ".github\workflows\test.yml") ".github\workflows\test.yml"
```

### 12.3 Create `README.md`

```powershell
@'
# cognitive-lab

Core research repository for active cognitive and post-alignment components.

## Included components

- LEAP analysis
- post_alignment_lab
- intuition-layer

## Repository purpose

This repository is the primary successor to the previous `scratch` structure
for actively maintained cognition / intuition / post-alignment work.

## Layout

- `leap_analysis/` - LEAP analysis scripts and tests
- `post_alignment_lab/` - post-alignment experiments and tooling
- `intuition-layer/` - intuition-layer implementation
- `docs/` - manuals, CI notes, and reports

## CI

- leap-analysis
- post-alignment-lab
- intuition-layer
'@ | Set-Content -Path "README.md"
```

### 12.4 Replace CI with Minimal Working Version

```powershell

  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:

          pip install pytest
      - name: Run intuition-layer tests
        run: |
          pytest intuition-layer
'@ | Set-Content -Path ".github\workflows\test.yml"
```

### 12.5 Local Smoke Test

Run these from the `cognitive-lab` root:

```powershell
Set-Location $env:COG

python -m pytest leap_analysis/test_leap_analysis.py
python -m pytest .\intuition-layer
python -m pytest .\post_alignment_lab
```

If either project depends on repo-root config from `scratch`, fix imports or config before push.

### 12.6 Commit and Push

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize cognitive-lab from scratch and restore active CI"
git push origin main
```

## 🕰️ Phase 2: Split `ea-aol` (History Preserved)

**[HISTORY PANEL :: EAAOL_PARTITION]**

### 13.1 Create Temporary Clone

```powershell
Set-Location $env:ROOT
git clone $env:SCRATCH "scratch-ea-aol-split"
Set-Location (Join-Path $env:ROOT "scratch-ea-aol-split")
```

### 13.2 Install `git-filter-repo` if Needed

```powershell
python -m pip install git-filter-repo
```

### 13.3 Filter to `ea-aol`

```powershell
git filter-repo --path ea-aol/ --path-rename ea-aol/: --force
```

### 13.4 Push to New Repository

```powershell
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/zerospawn01-coder/ea-aol.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🕰️ Phase 3: Split `mtp-weaver` (History Preserved)

**[HISTORY PANEL :: MTPWEAVER_PARTITION]**

### 14.1 Create Temporary Clone

```powershell
Set-Location $env:ROOT
git clone $env:SCRATCH "scratch-mtp-weaver-split"
Set-Location (Join-Path $env:ROOT "scratch-mtp-weaver-split")
```

### 14.2 Filter to `mtp_weaver`

```powershell
git filter-repo --path mtp_weaver/ --path-rename mtp_weaver/: --force
```

### 14.3 Push to New Repository

```powershell
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/zerospawn01-coder/mtp-weaver.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🧪 Phase 4: Create `lab-experiments`

**[RESEARCH PANEL :: LABEXP_CONSOLIDATION]**

For a concise operator checklist focused only on this move, use `LAB_EXPERIMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` alongside this section.

Use the generated split plan as the source of truth. In the optimized 5-repo layout, `lab-experiments` is the shared home for the three non-core experiment and personal directories that are worth preserving now without creating more repositories.

For minimal layout specifically, `project_manuals/` folds into `cognitive-lab/docs/manuals/`. Additional reviewed directories such as `AI-Browser-Core/`, `Antigravity-Forge/`, `cognitive-substrate/`, and `sovereign-arena-chaos/` stay deferred in `scratch` rather than being forced into `lab-experiments` during phase 1.

### 15.1 Copy Directories

```powershell
Set-Location $env:LABEXP

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "docs" | Out-Null

Copy-Item -Recurse -Force (Join-Path $env:SCRATCH "jepa_intuition_poc") .
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force (Join-Path $env:SCRATCH "geodesic_descent") .
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force (Join-Path $env:SCRATCH "personal_ai") .
```

### 15.2 Create `README.md`

```powershell
@'
# lab-experiments

Experimental and proof-of-concept repository.

## Included projects

- jepa_intuition_poc
- geodesic_descent
- personal_ai

## Deferred after phase 1

- AI-Browser-Core
- Antigravity-Forge
- cognitive-substrate
- sovereign-arena-chaos
- aesthetic-resonator
- autonomous-task-gen
- clean-room-v1.0.0
- live_agents
- mvp_halt
'@ | Set-Content -Path "README.md"
```

### 15.3 Commit and Push

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize lab-experiments from scratch"
git push origin main
```

## 🗄️ Phase 5: Archiving `scratch`

**[CLEANUP PANEL :: SOURCE_DEPRECATION]**

Only do this after the new repositories are verified.

### 16.1 Preferred Scripted Archive Flow

Use the archive helper after validating copy and filter-repo dry-runs.

```powershell
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_archive.ps1 -Layout recommended -WhatIf
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_archive.ps1 -Layout minimal -WhatIf
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_archive.ps1 -Layout recommended -ExcludedAction archive -WhatIf
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_archive.ps1 -Layout recommended -ExcludedAction delete -WhatIf
```

Behavior:

- `ReportFiles` from the plan are moved into `docs/reports/` or `docs/archive/` inside `scratch`
- `ExcludedAction keep` leaves `antigravity_dashboard/`, `system_sentinel/`, and `tts_narrator/` untouched and only reports them
- `ExcludedAction archive` moves those placeholder directories into `docs/excluded/`
- `ExcludedAction delete` removes those placeholder directories after review

Final split execution should normally use `-ExcludedAction archive`; `delete` is only for a later cleanup pass after manual review.

### 16.2 Create Archive Directories

```powershell
Set-Location $env:SCRATCH

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "docs\archive" | Out-Null
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "docs\reports" | Out-Null
```

### 16.3 Move Report Files if They Exist

```powershell
$reportFiles = @(
  "CODE_QUALITY_REVIEW.md",
  "CRITICAL_EVALUATION_REPORT.md",
  "FINAL_UNIT_TEST_REPORT.md",
  "UNIT_TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md",
  "PUBLICATION_READINESS_REPORT.md"
)

foreach ($file in $reportFiles) {
  if (Test-Path $file) {
    Move-Item -Force $file "docs\reports\"
  }
}

$archiveFiles = @(
  "FINAL_WORK_SUMMARY.md",
  "TODAY_WORK_SUMMARY.md"
)

foreach ($file in $archiveFiles) {
  if (Test-Path $file) {
    Move-Item -Force $file "docs\archive\"
  }
}
```

### 16.4 Replace `README.md`

```powershell
@'
# scratch

Archive / staging repository after split.

Active work has moved to:
- cognitive-lab
- ea-aol
- mtp-weaver
- lab-experiments
'@ | Set-Content -Path "README.md"
```

### 16.5 Commit and Push

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Archive scratch after repository split"
git push origin main
```

## ✅ Final Verification: State Settlement

**[AUDIT PANEL :: POST_SPLIT_VALIDATION]**

### 17.1 Check Local Repository State

```powershell
$repos = @($env:COG, $env:EAAOL, $env:MTP, $env:LABEXP)

foreach ($repo in $repos) {
  Write-Host "== $repo =="
  Set-Location $repo
  git remote -v
  git status
}
```

### 17.2 Check on GitHub

Verify these manually:

- `cognitive-lab` Actions are green
- `ea-aol` default branch is `main`
- `mtp-weaver` default branch is `main`
- `lab-experiments` contains the confirmed grouped experiment directories for the layout you executed
- `project-manuals` exists if you are using the 5-repo layout
- `scratch` README shows archive status

## 🛠️ Operational Strategy

**[STRATEGY PANEL :: EXECUTION_PROTOCOL]**

1. Checkpoint `scratch`
2. Create `cognitive-lab`
3. Make `cognitive-lab` CI green
4. Split `ea-aol` with `git filter-repo`
5. Split `mtp-weaver` with `git filter-repo`
6. Create `lab-experiments` by copy
7. Create `project-manuals` by copy if using the 5-repo layout
8. Archive `scratch`

## 19. Notes

- This runbook documents commands only. It does not perform the split by itself.
- If `post_alignment_lab` or `intuition-layer` depend on top-level files from `scratch`, fix those dependencies before enabling CI.
- Use temporary clones for `git filter-repo`. Do not run it against your main working copy unless that is intentional.

## 20. Next Step Decision Rule

Choose A before B when the full `scratch` tree is available and you need a final migration contract.

- A: Produce a confirmed inventory from the real `scratch` checkout and replace planning assumptions with exact paths.
- B: Script the execution flow only after the inventory is stable enough that copy targets and `git filter-repo` paths are unlikely to change.

In practice, the safest order is:

1. Confirm A against the real tree.
2. Freeze the mapping table.
3. Use B to automate the now-stable plan.

## 21. Non-Destructive Planning Script

This repository now includes a planning script at `tools/repo_split_plan.ps1`.

It does not execute copy, clone, or filter operations. It emits the currently documented split plan so that the migration can be reviewed before writing or running execution scripts.

The emitted plan now carries these fields per mapping row:

- `SourcePath`
- `Category`
- `TargetRepo`
- `TargetPath`
- `MigrationMode`
- `Confidence`
- `Disposition`

Example usage:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_plan.ps1
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_plan.ps1 -Layout minimal
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_plan.ps1 -AsJson
```

Use this script as the bridge between the current runbook and a later fully automated split script.

## 22. Dry-Run Execution Scripts

The following scripts now exist for execution-phase rehearsal:

- `tools/repo_split_copy.ps1`
- `tools/repo_split_filter_repo.ps1`
- `tools/repo_split_archive.ps1`

All three scripts are built around PowerShell `ShouldProcess`, so they support `-WhatIf` and are intended to be reviewed in dry-run mode first.

The execution scripts honor `Disposition = exclude`, so excluded paths are surfaced in preview output and handled according to the script's mode.

### 22.1 Copy-Based Repositories

Use the copy script for repositories created by file copy rather than history-preserving extraction.

```powershell
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_copy.ps1 -Layout recommended -WhatIf
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_copy.ps1 -Layout minimal -WhatIf
```

This covers repositories such as:

- `cognitive-lab`
- `lab-experiments`
- `project-manuals`

### 22.2 History-Preserving Repositories

Use the filter-repo script for repositories that should keep their Git history.

```powershell
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_filter_repo.ps1 -Layout recommended -WhatIf
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_filter_repo.ps1 -Layout recommended -WhatIf -Push
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_filter_repo.ps1 -Layout recommended -RemoteScheme ssh -WhatIf
```

The script now defaults to HTTPS remotes. Use `-RemoteScheme ssh` only after SSH host keys and credentials are configured, or supply `-RemoteBaseUrl` if you need a different Git host.

This covers repositories such as:

- `ea-aol`
- `mtp-weaver`

Keep `-Push` disabled until the temporary filtered clones are inspected.

### 22.3 Archive / Report Cleanup

Use the archive script to normalize report files under `docs/reports/` and `docs/archive/` inside `scratch`, and to preview how excluded placeholders should be handled.

```powershell
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_archive.ps1 -Layout recommended -ExcludedAction archive -WhatIf
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_archive.ps1 -Layout recommended -WhatIf
pwsh -File .\tools\repo_split_archive.ps1 -Layout recommended -ExcludedAction delete -WhatIf
```

Default behavior keeps excluded placeholders untouched and only reports them, but the standard execution policy is to rerun with `-ExcludedAction archive` once the split is ready.
