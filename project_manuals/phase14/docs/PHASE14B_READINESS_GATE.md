# Phase14-B Readiness Gate (Week4 Fri)

## Gate Objective

```text
Evaluate 4-week Phase14-A operational results,
and decide whether to proceed to Phase14-B (Rule Learning Stabilization).
```

---

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|
| selection_accuracy | >= baseline +10% | |
| human_override_rate | < 5% | |
| review_throughput | >= 80 candidates/hour | |
| candidate_generation | < 100/week | |
| rejection_reason_distribution | explainable by taxonomy | |
| novel_case_ratio | < 15% | |

---

## Decision Logic

### PASS

```text
All primary metrics meet threshold.
novel_case_ratio is within tolerance.
Review cadence is stable.
```

Outcome:

```text
Start Phase14-B.
Enable rule lifecycle management.
```

---

### HOLD

```text
1-2 metrics miss threshold.
Candidate explosion or review throughput instability is present.
```

Actions:

```text
Tune rule_mining thresholds.
Rebalance review queue.
Run 2 additional weeks.
```

---

### ESCALATE

```text
novel_case_ratio > 15%.
Large volume of taxonomy-unexplainable rejections.
Rule drift increases sharply.
```

Actions:

```text
HLG review required.
Taxonomy revision.
Capability matrix redesign.
```
